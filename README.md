# Finding the key factors that lead to Heart Disease - Daisy Intelligence Hackathon
 The same 14 parameters are almost always used to detect heart disease. This project aims to discover whether any of the 62 other possible parameters have an impact on heart disease. Our results suggest that while they may have no impact on whether a person has heart disease, they are significant because they are significant in determining the severity of heart disease
